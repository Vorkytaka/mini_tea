/// A typedef representing a factory function to create a [Feature] instance.
///
/// This is typically used to lazily or eagerly instantiate a [Feature]
/// within a [FeatureProvider].
///
/// - [F]: The type of the [Feature].
/// - [S]: The type of the state managed by the feature.
/// - [M]: The type of messages handled by the feature.
/// - [E]: The type of effects emitted by the feature.
/// ```

/// A provider widget for managing and exposing a [Feature] to the widget tree.
///
/// [FeatureProvider] allows you to create or provide an existing [Feature] instance
/// and makes it available to its descendants in the widget tree using the [FeatureProvider.of] method.
///
/// ### Usage
///
/// There are two ways to use [FeatureProvider]:
/// 1. **Create Mode**: Instantiate a [Feature] dynamically:
///    ```dart
///    FeatureProvider.create(
///      create: (context) => MyFeature(...),
///      child: MyWidget(),
///    );
///    ```
///
/// 2. **Value Mode**: Provide an existing [Feature] instance:
///    ```dart
///    FeatureProvider.value(
///      value: myFeatureInstance,
///      child: MyWidget(),
///    );
///    ```
///
/// ### Key Parameters
/// - [F]: The type of the [Feature].
/// - [S]: The type of the state managed by the feature.
/// - [M]: The type of messages handled by the feature.
/// - [E]: The type of effects emitted by the feature.
